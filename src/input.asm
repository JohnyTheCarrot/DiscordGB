; Controller reading ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This controller reading routine is optimized for size.
; It stores currently pressed keys in hCurrentKeys (1=pressed) and
; keys newly pressed since last read in hNewKeys, with the same
; nibble ordering as the Game Boy Advance.
